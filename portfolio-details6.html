              <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
              <p>
                The majority of employment will be affected in some way or another as automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology develops. Numerous variables will affect the extent and severity of the impact. The chances of success in one career over another cannot be generalized. The idea was that everyone would eventually receive a free stipend to be used to purchase the goods we needed because soon robots would perform all the labor and no one would need a job. As a computer engineer, I found this to be absurd. Most people are terrified of losing their jobs as a result of the growth of artificial intelligence, particularly recent graduates. Approximately 68.5% of them, as opposed to just 55% of other non-workers, worry about being replaced by AI. The occupations most likely to be replaced by AI technology are cashiers and drivers. Some contend that if we place a lot of faith in artificial intelligence (AI), it could avoid corruption and enhance the business. Chatbots for customer service are a common illustration of how AI could eliminate our employment. because machine learning and natural language processing were used to determine part of the message intent in the chat box. It can read conversations quickly and provide condensed answers to frequently requested questions. The majority of organizations use it to save expenses and increase customer satisfaction. More and more individuals are becoming open to the concept of adopting AI into their daily lives as time goes on. They have no problem with AI taking over routine duties or participating in decision-making. On the other hand, adoption of AI is complicated by skepticism and worries about AI hazards. The most intriguing patterns that have captured our attention are listed below.
